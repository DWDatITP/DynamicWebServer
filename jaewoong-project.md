### Public-Garden-Like-Page

#### Description
I want to create a single web page that everyone can contribute to and ruin as well. Think as a public garden: you can visit the page and plant some flowers onto the page, and also can ruin others flower if you really would.
But I'm not going to make a literal garden on the web. Instead, people may drag and drop their local files to make an interesting change to the page. I'm not settled about specific interactions and idea yet. But the key idea is similar to a public garden: everybody can make changes to the page.
